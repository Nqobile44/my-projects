# SquirrelTracker

SquirrelTracker is an application designed to help users track the presence of squirrels in their local area. The app allows users to log sightings of squirrels and keeps track of the number of sightings by location. This project is a fun way to engage with data collection and analysis, and it can also be used as a learning tool for working with databases and data visualization.
