## 📊 JSON Data Conversion to Excel

This project demonstrates my ability to work with JSON files using Python and convert specific structured data into a well-formatted Excel spreadsheet. The program reads a JSON file, extracts relevant information, processes it, and organizes it into a structured Excel file with properly formatted rows and columns.

The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in:

- Extracting and processing specific data from a JSON file
- Structuring data into a clean and readable Excel format
- Automating data transformation for better accessibility and analysis
This project highlights my ability to handle data efficiently, which is essential for roles involving data processing, automation, and backend development.
