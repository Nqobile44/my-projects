# Excel To JSON


## üìä Excel Data Extraction and JSON Conversion

This project demonstrates my ability to work with Excel files using Python and convert the extracted data into a structured JSON format. The program reads an Excel file cell by cell, extracts relevant information, processes it, and saves the output as a clean JSON file.

The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in:

- Extracting and processing data from Excel files
- Cleaning and organizing data programmatically
- Converting data into a usable format for further analysis or application
This project highlights my ability to handle data efficiently, which is essential for roles involving data processing, automation, or backend development.



## üéØ Project Purpose

The main objective of this project is to showcase my ability to:

- Navigate and extract specific data from an Excel file
- Process and clean the extracted data, including handling date formatting
- Convert structured Excel data into JSON for easy integration with APIs, web applications, or databases
This project is a reflection of my skills in working with real-world data formats and my ability to build efficient, functional Python scripts for data processing tasks.



## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used
- Python 3 ‚Äì Core programming language
- openpyxl ‚Äì Library for reading and writing Excel files
- json ‚Äì Built-in Python library for working with JSON data



## üî• What This Project Demonstrates
- Extracting specific data from an Excel spreadsheet
- Converting structured data into JSON format
- Basic data cleaning, such as formatting date fields
- Organizing code into clear, understandable modules for easy maintenance



## üìÑ How It Works
- Data Extraction

  - The program reads the Excel file from a defined range, cell by cell.
  - Column headers are automatically extracted from a specific row.
  
- Data Processing
  -Cleans the extracted data by formatting dates and organizing the information into dictionaries.

- JSON Conversion
  - Converts the cleaned data into a structured JSON format.
  - Saves the final output into a JSON file for easy access and further use.


 
## üöÄ Why This Project Matters
This project showcases my ability to handle data extraction, cleaning, and transformation‚Äîskills that are essential for roles in data analysis, automation, and backend development. It demonstrates my problem-solving ability and attention to detail when working with real-world data formats like Excel and JSON.
